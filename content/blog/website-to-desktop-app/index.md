A handy feature of Chrome lets you create *Shortcuts* for websites. 

You can configure it under `Chrome > More tools > Create shortcut`. 

This way the website feels like a Desktop-App since it is separated from the browser window. It integrates well in GNOME (3.38.3). Like normal applications it can be launched from the Activities-View and added to the Dock.

Finally, for me there's no need for (unofficial) Electron wrappers anymore if I miss a Desktop version of an App.

Credit where credit's due - I found it through the [Web Weekly Newsletter](https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/web-weekly-18/#pro-tip%3A-how-to-get-sites-you-use-daily-out-of-your-browser).
